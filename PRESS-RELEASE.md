A place for people looking for ideas and ideas looking for people.

**Have an idea to share? Need to find one?**  
Glint is a forum for people to both share and find ideas. People give feedback. They upvote, they downvote, they comment. The ideas you find on Glint are vetted by the community. Gain karma. Find a vetted idea.

2: see heading for this paragraph

**You want to give back.**  
3: you have so much love to give to other people's ideas
